# Data-analytics
This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in
a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from
applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA
module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk
analytics in banking and financial services and understand
how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while
lending to customers.

When the company receives a loan application, the
company has to decide for loan approval based on the
applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the
bank’s decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not
approving the loan results in a loss of business to
the company.
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e.
he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan
may lead to a financial loss for the company.
